# accesibility-refactoring
## Task
For this assignment we were tasked with cleaning up an already existing code and adding the proper accesibility features.

This included adding proper semantic html tags, alt text to images, and consolidating the CSS to be easier to read.
## Application
You can use this [link](https://github.com/graham1996/accesibility-refactoring) to access the GitHub repo with the web application.
